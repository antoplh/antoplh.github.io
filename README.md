# Kanban Board with Markdown

Kanban Board developed by following [dcode's tutorial](https://youtu.be/ijQ6dCughW8) on YouTube.

Added Markdown reading with [markedjs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://github.com/markedjs/marked&ved=2ahUKEwjl-of6hor4AhWkA9QKHV1lBvwQFnoECA4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1JBUcpcl9VZRjPdhQPzYCL).

It has some limitations that I intend to fix in the future.
- Doesn't read multiple lines
- Doesn't save the data in a server
- Double click to delete gets in the way of editing

## Access

You can access the Board in [here](https://antoplh.github.io/index.html)
